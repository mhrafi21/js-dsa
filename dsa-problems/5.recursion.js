// Recursion
// recursion is a problem solving technique that involves breaking a problem into smaller instances of the same problem until the problem is solved. Recursion is a common technique used in computer science and mathematics. It is used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are similar to the original problem. Recursion is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide range of problems, from simple mathematical problems to complex computer science problems.

Recursive Fibonacci sequence contd.
-------------------
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

if F represents a function to calculate the Fibonacci number , then
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
base case: 
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
